# Job+ 
Job+ consolidates searches distinct to work/life balance into a single page application to help job seekers better understand their potential work environments. The application aggregates data from Indeed, Yelp and Google Maps/Places. Job+ is built atop a Node/Express backend in conjunction with a React/Redux frontend. A Redis backend was implemented to cache frequently searched regions for faster load times. Other technologies used in development included Axios/Mocha/Chia for testing and Webpack for compiling, linting, etc.
